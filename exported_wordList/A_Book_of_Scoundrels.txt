It is 9/.    also employed in the language of prophecy; as the day shall come when 10/.    /. /. /.   since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy 11/.    nearly coincide in significance/. In shall with the first person the 12/.    necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than 13/.    in the speaker; as I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is always a 14/.    less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is indicated 15/.    by will/. I shall go implies nearly a simple futurity; more exactly a 16/.    foretelling or an expectation of my going in which naturally enough 17/.    a certain degree of plan or intention may be included; emphasize the 18/.    shall and the event is described as certain to occur and the 19/.    expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic I will go/. In a 20/.    question the relation of speaker and source of obligation is of course 21/.    transferred to the person addressed; as Shall you go? (answer I 22/.    shall go); Shall he go? i/. e/. Do you require or promise his 23/.    going? (answer He shall go/.) The same relation is transferred to 24/.    either second or third person in such phrases as You say or think 25/.    you shall go; He says or thinks he shall go/. After a conditional 26/.    conjunction (as if whether) shall is used in all persons to express 27/.    futurity simply; as if I you or he shall say they are right/. Should 28/.    is everywhere used in the same connection and the same senses as shall 29/.    as its imperfect/. It also expresses duty or moral obligation; as he 30/.    should do it whether he will or not/. In the early English and hence in 31/.    our English Bible shall is the auxiliary mainly used in all the 32/.    persons to express simple futurity/. (Cf/. Will v/. t/.) Shall may be 33/.    used elliptically; thus with an adverb or other word expressive of 34/.    motion go may be omitted/.
